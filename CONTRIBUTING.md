# Contributing
## Create an issue or a discission?
If you want to report a bug or request a feature then you create an issue. Basically, you can say, create an issue, if what you want to say will affect the source code. Otherwise,
e.g. if you have a question or feedback, open a discussion.
## Your improvements and contributing to the source code
If you found a bug or want to improve the code, please always create an issue. That way I can keep track of the bugs in my project. You can fix the bug by yourself, if you want
to. Then, you can create apull request and attach it to your issue. If it is possible, I will merge the pull request.
## What can you contribute?
If you want to contribute, bo√∫t don't know what to do, look at the current issues. There you can find bugs to fix ore improvements to implement. If there is nothing that you like,
you can always go to the discussions and ask me what you can do. I surely will have work for you.
## So go on, start contributing
I'm looking forward to your contributions
